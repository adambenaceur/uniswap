# uniswap on rinkeby testnet  ðŸ¦„


##  how it works:

The Dapp moves ethereum from one wallet to another wallet using a smart contract called Transactions.sol (in the code base).

##  testing: 
1) Dapp is deployed to : https://uniswap-blockchain-app-delta.vercel.app . Open the link to start the app.

2) Make sure to have metamask installed.

3) For testing purposes. Choose a test-net wallet in metamask. The recommended test net is rinkeby as that is what I used to run this program.

4) Add ETH to the test-net wallet using a rinkeby-faucet. One that you can use is this: https://rinkebyfaucet.com/ .

5) With the ETH in the test-net wallet. Create 2 wallets (One reciever and One sender).

6) Send to the reciving address and the amount using the interface.
